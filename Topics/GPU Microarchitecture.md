# GPU Microarchitecture

## What

*Stub topic — to be expanded from sources.*

## Current understanding

GPU microarchitecture knowledge in this wiki currently centers on the Hopper (H100) generation, cross-compared against Ampere (A100) and Ada (RTX 4090/L40), via a systematic microbenchmark study [[2026-01-15-benchmarking-and-dissecting-the-nvidia-h]]. The core insight is that Hopper's generational gains over Ampere are not primarily from higher clock speeds or raw IPC improvements — they come from three architectural additions that require programmer awareness to exploit: the **Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA)**, **Distributed Shared Memory (DSM)**, and **DPX instructions**.

**TMA** enables asynchronous block-level copies between global and shared memory without occupying threads, building on Ampere's `cuda::memcpy_async`. Its payoff is compute/memory overlap — microbenchmarks show this kicks in at specific matrix dimensions and block sizes (tested 2048-element matrices, 8×8 to 32×32 blocks). **DSM** allows SMs within a thread block cluster to read, write, and atomically operate on each other's shared memory directly, reducing L2/HBM traffic for cooperative SM work. **DPX** accelerates dynamic-programming primitives in hardware (min/max over previously computed solutions); on earlier GPUs the CUDA 12+ API emulates this in software.

**Tensor Core precision evolution** across generations follows a clear accumulation pattern: Volta added FP16/FP32, Ampere added INT8/INT4/FP64/BF16/TF32 and structured sparsity, and Hopper adds **FP8** — the qualitatively important step for LLM training and inference. The microbenchmarks measure tensor-core instruction latency and throughput at each precision across all three generations, providing the undisclosed micro-architectural data sheet that NVIDIA's official specs omit.

The **Transformer Engine (TE) limitations** are a load-bearing practical finding: `te.Linear` is the only fully FP8-quantized operator path; Softmax and GeLU are not quantized to FP8 in the current TE, causing data-format-conversion overhead. Critically, `DotProductAttention` uses FlashAttention rather than FP8 Tensor Cores, so attention in TE does not benefit from FP8 at all. This explains why real LLM FP8 speedups fall short of the theoretical 2× over FP16 that peak tensor-core rates suggest. Benchmarks across LLaMA 7B (hidden=4096), 13B (5120), and 70B (8192) show the hidden-size sensitivity of these gaps.

The practical implication for workload designers: **pure FP16 compute workloads gain little from upgrading Ampere → Hopper**; workloads combining FP8 with heavy async data movement gain substantially. DPX hardware is present but underutilized by current LLM workloads — adjacent domains (speculative decoding tree search, scientific sequence alignment) are the plausible near-term targets. The paper's microbenchmark methodology — instruction-level → library-level → application-level — is itself a reusable template for characterizing future GPU generations.

- TMA + DSM interaction: do they compose well, or is using both simultaneously bandwidth-bottlenecked? The paper benchmarks each in isolation. — [[2026-01-15-benchmarking-and-dissecting-the-nvidia-h]]

- SemiAnalysis Tensor Core Evolution（Dylan Patel）提供从 Volta 到 Blackwell 的 TC 架构演进全景：MMA 作用域（quadpair→warp→warpgroup→single-thread）、操作数位置（register→SMEM→TMEM）、精度（FP16→FP8→FP4/NVFP4）、异步化（同步→HGMMA commit/fence→tcgen05 完全异步）；关键量化：TC 吞吐每代翻倍但全局内存延迟未降，SMEM 每代增长以维持 staging buffer；Blackwell TMEM（256KB）功耗效率更高，因操作数 D 被访问 2Kt 次（A/B 各 1 次）。 — [[2026-01-15-nvidia-tensor-core-evolution-from-volta-]]
- JAX Scaling Book Ch. 12 provides a comprehensive GPU-TPU component mapping and multi-generation spec table: H100 (132 SMs, 990 bf16 TFLOPs, 3.35 TB/s HBM) → B200 (148 SMs, 2.25 PFLOPs bf16, 8 TB/s HBM, 192GB). Critical intensity (FLOPs/BW) ≈ 295 for H100 fp16, 281 for B200 — need batch ~280 to be compute-bound. B200 adds TMEM (256kB/SM) because TC accumulator no longer fits in registers/SMEM. SIMT vs SIMD comparison: each CUDA core has its own instruction pointer enabling branch divergence, unlike TPU VPU where all ALUs must execute the same instruction. — [[2025-12-11-how-to-think-about-gpus-how-to-scale-you]]
